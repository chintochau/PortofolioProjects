3,Data Analyst,Mastercard Toronto,,"Our Purpose

We work to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere by making transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible. Using secure data and networks, partnerships and passion, our innovations and solutions help individuals, financial institutions, governments and businesses realize their greatest potential. Our decency quotient, or DQ, drives our culture and everything we do inside and outside of our company. We cultivate a culture of inclusion for all employees that respects their individual strengths, views, and experiences. We believe that our differences enable us to be a better team – one that makes better decisions, drives innovation and delivers better business results.

Job Title

Data Analyst

Mastercard’s Enterprise Security Solutions organization develops and delivers world-class security products and services for customers across the globe.  NuData Security predicts fraudulent transactions by identifying good users from bad, based on their online behavior. By analyzing over 38 billion behaviors annually, NuData harnesses the power of behavioral and biometric analysis to empower its clients to predict fraud and verify the user behind the device. This allows clients to predict fraud before a critical decision, reduce customer insult, and investigate bad actors efficiently.

We are looking for a Data Analyst to join our team in our Toronto or Vancouver office.

You are a determined pattern-finder, one that delights in the tough puzzles because nothing satisfies like finally cracking one. Dig into weird, needle-in-a-haystack Internet-based fraud cases. Ferret out suspicious behaviour from the innocuous. Decipher the pattern, find the fraud and then figure out how to catch it in the future. You’ll back up your findings with deep statistical analysis and robust data modeling, which will go on to inform feature design and fraud investigation strategy for NuData product offerings. You'll produce compelling visuals, exciting dashboards and give fantastic presentations to both internal and external stakeholders.

Qualifications
Exceptional written and verbal communication skills, with an advanced level of experience in presenting to various audiences (both size and type of audience).
Intermediate level of data analysis and reporting experience in professional setting;
Experience dealing with large data sets;
Experience with SQL and the ability to create complex queries and joins;
Strong data analysis and data modeling skills;

In addition to these qualifications, you will be required to provide a professional sample of technical writing from a previous project or position. Candidates without experience in a professional setting will not be considered for this role.

Bonus Points
Experience with machine learning (supervised or unsupervised);
Experience with high level programming languages: Python, PHP, or similar;
Experience with data tools: R, SPSS, SAS and Tableau;
High level concepts of Web Services, Internet Security and Online Behavioral Analysis.

COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must
